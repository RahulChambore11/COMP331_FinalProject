# COMP331 Final Project — Data Warehousing Quality Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a reproducible **ETL pipeline** to transform raw retail datasets into a clean **star schema** for data warehousing. The focus is on evaluating and improving **data quality dimensions** — completeness, validity, uniqueness, and consistency — to ensure reliable analytics.

The project uses three core datasets:
- **Sales** — weekly transaction records across stores and departments
- **Stores** — descriptive attributes such as type and size
- **Features** — contextual variables including holidays and regional conditions

---

## 🛠️ ETL Pipeline
The ETL process consists of:
1. **Extract** — Load raw CSV files (Sales, Stores, Features).
2. **Transform** — Clean missing values, enforce validity rules, deduplicate records.
3. **Load** — Build star schema tables:
   - `dim_store`
   - `dim_date`
   - `dim_features`
   - `fact_sales`

---

## 📊 Data Quality Evidence
Outputs generated by the ETL pipeline:
- **Row counts** — FactSales table with 840,424 valid rows.
- **Integrity checks** — Orphan key counts (`fk_integrity_fact.csv`).
- **Unknown store ratio** — Evidence of surrogate handling.
- **Missing/duplicate summaries** — Completeness and uniqueness reports.
- **Charts**:
  - `chart_store_type_distribution.png`
  - `chart_weekly_sales_hist.png`

## 🚀 How to Reproduce
1. Create a Python virtual environment and install requirements:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Run the ETL script:
   python scripts/04_etl_build_star.py

3. Check outputs in:

   data/processed/ for dimension/fact tables
   results/ for integrity summaries and charts
